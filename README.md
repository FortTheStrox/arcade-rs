# Arcade-rs
This project is to incite practice with Rust and the sdl2 crate.

## Code Origins
This code is based off jadpole's arcade-rs project [here](https://github.com/jadpole/jadpole.github.io/tree/eced69c0b8e6301e74b09dca7026bd2b760c3c64). Since the repo is pretty old I'm attempting to recreate the project in the updated rust version. I hope I can stay motivated to see this to the end.
